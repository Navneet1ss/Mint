# Mint
A barebones Node.js app using Express 4.



Running Locally
Pull down repository

git clone https://github.com/treyhboy/Mint.git # or clone your own fork
cd Mint
Make sure you have Node.js and MySQL installed.

npm install
npm start
You can also use Docker to run the app. This will remove the requirement of MySQL installed on your local machine and will run MySQL in a Docker container.

docker-compose up -d
Your app should now be running on localhost:3100.
